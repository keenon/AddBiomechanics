# This command will take as input an arbitrary OSIM file with an arbitrary markerset, and another
# arbitrary "target" OSIM file, and will output a new OSIM file which is the same as the "target" OSIM skeleton, but
# with the markerset from the first OSIM file. This uses a combination of the following techniques:
# - Aligning markers based on shared Geometry (meshes reused between models are a great clue about structure)
# - Aligning based on common joint structure (once joints are aligned, then marker attach points can often be guessed)

# THIS IS HEURISTIC! You should still check the output of this command to make sure it makes sense. Open up the OSIM
# files that you get to make sure that they're not putting markers in crazy places.
