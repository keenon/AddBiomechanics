class ThresholdsDetector(AbstractDetector):
    """
    This detector uses a set of thresholds to detect frames that we would like to exclude from a
    dynamics-of-human-motion dataset. It was engineered by referencing the 3M+ frames of manually annotated data that
    we labeled as "good" and "bad" in the process of publishing the first AddB dataset paper. The experimental log is
    here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16dgRho13iFyfhQSlYNsdIj7Rer2-MZP_aKtYQj41CQs/edit.

    The method here was originally developed in another repo, here: https://github.com/keenon/MissingGRFEstimator

    The entry point is estimate_missing_grfs(), which takes a SubjectOnDisk object and a list of trials, and returns a
    list of lists of MissingGRFReason enums, one for each frame in each trial. The MissingGRFReason enum is defined in
    the NimblePhysics library, and is used to indicate why a frame is being marked as "bad" in the dataset, to make
    it easier for users to understand why their frames are being dropped.
