      <h1>Mission</h1>
      <p>The mission of AddBiomechanics is two-fold:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>To make it easier and faster to generate high-quality, quantitative biomechanics data.</li>
        <li>To create a large-scale repository of biomechanics data that is open to the research community, so we can
          together
          improve movement and mobility for all people.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>License for the Software and Data</h2>
      <p>To achieve this mission, we are sharing AddBiomechanics freely with anyone who would like to use it, under the
        <a href="https://opensource.org/license/gpl-3-0/" target="_blank">GPL v3.0 License</a>.
        By uploading data to AddBiomechanics you agree to share it with a <a
          href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank"> Creative Commons BY 4.0 License</a>,
        (more details are
        below).
      </p>
      <p>We share the AddBiomechanics source code so that researchers can fully understand the methods. We highly
        encourage you to
        use the web application rather than building the code from source. Note that we are a small team and are not
        able to support
        individuals wishing to build from source.</p>

      <h2>Will I Be Acknowledged for Sharing My Data?</h2>
      <p>The <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons BY 4.0 License</a>
        requires that users
        acknowledge you when they use the data. We also provide a list of citations in a <code>DATA_CITATIONS.txt</code>
        file with each downloaded
        dataset so users know how to acknowledge you for the data you share.</p>
      <p>Make sure you: (1) update your user profile to include your name and institution, and (2) annotate each of your
        data
        folders with any publications or other references that users of your data should cite.</p>

      <h2>What If I Want to Test AddBiomechanics Before Sharing Data?</h2>
      <p>We know that data may not be ready right away for others to view, download, and use, so we provide the
        following data
        sharing options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When you upload your data, it will by default be tagged as an &quot;Unfinalized Draft&quot;. You can share
          this data by
          providing colleagues with a link, but it won't appear in the public search results view unless users
          explicitly
          check the box to show draft data. &quot;Unfinalized Draft&quot; data may still be included in the large
          aggregate human motion
          datasets that we publish from time-to-time, if it is not a duplicate and passes our automated quality checks,
          though
          it will be marked as a draft in the <code>DATA_CITATIONS.txt</code> file, so that end users know you have not
          certified this data
          as complete.</li>
        <li>Once you click &quot;Publish&quot; your data will be automatically searchable. </li>
        <li>By default, data uploaded to AddBiomechanics is not searchable. It is important to
          note,
          however, that while AddBiomechanics makes a best effort at security, it <em><strong>is not cleared to store
              PHI or HIPAA
              data</strong></em>, so the private folder should be used only to process data that is not subject to these
          constraints.
          Users may only upload up to 10 test trials to this private folder. </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Can I Delete My Data?</h2>
      <p>Please be aware that we retain copies of all processed data, even
        if it is subsequently
        deleted from your personal account. We make this data available from time to time in large aggregate datasets of
        all the data that
        has been
        processed by AddBiomechanics. These datasets include screens to check for data quality and provide users the
        option to convert
        all data to standardized OpenSim skeleton types to make aggregate analysis easier.</p>

      <h2>How Do I Inform Participants of How Their Data Will Be Used?</h2>
      <p>As with all human subjects research, you must ensure your work has been approved by your institution's ethics
        committee and
        you have informed participants of how their data will be used.</p>
      <p>You could use language like the following in your consent (IRB) forms to inform participants about how you will
        share their
        data, and give them the option to opt out.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>&quot;I understand that my motion capture data (i.e., the time-history of how my body segments are moving
          when I walk or
          perform other movements) will be shared in a public repository. Sharing my data will enable others to
          replicate the
          results of this study, and enable future progress in human motion science. This motion data will not be linked
          with any
          other identifiable information about me.&quot;</li>
        <li>&quot;Biomechanics data are processed using the AddBiomechanics web application and stored in Amazon Web
          Services (AWS) S3
          instances. All drafted and published data stored in these instances are publicly accessible to AddBiomechanics
          users. Data
          stored in private user folders are not accessible. Public data will be accessible through the web interface
          and through
          aggregated data distributions hosted on SimTK.org.&quot;</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What Do I Say to IT to Get Them to Let Me Use AddBiomechanics?</h2>
      <p>&quot;Study participants consented to public data sharing, and no sensitive or private data is ever passed to
        or stored in
        AddBiomechanics.org. All data uploaded to the AddBiomechanics.org service is intended to be immediately publicly
        accessible.&quot;</p>
      <p>Most IT departments will then stop asking questions, because AddBiomechanics falls into the &quot;extremely low
        risk&quot; and/or
        &quot;publicly accessible&quot; category of data sensitivity.</p>
